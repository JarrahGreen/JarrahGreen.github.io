<h3>Lessons learnt:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I learnt a lot about OOP as java is my first OOP language</li>
    <li>How to use Art in games</li>
</ul>

<h3>My overview:</h3>

<p>I knew that I was going to be using Java at university and I really enjoy games development.
THis project was therefore perfect to learn about developing games as well as using java.
I have not used any OOP languages before so this project took around 3 months as I was used to procedural languages.</p>
