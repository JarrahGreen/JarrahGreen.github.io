<ul>
    <li>I learnt a lot about OOP as java is my first OOP language</li>
    <li>How to use Art in games/li>

<h5>My overview:</h5>
<p>I knew that I was going to be using Java at university and I really enjoy games development.
THis project was therefore perfect to learn about developing games as well as using java.
I have not used any OOP languages before so this project took around 3 months as I was used to procedural languages.</p>
