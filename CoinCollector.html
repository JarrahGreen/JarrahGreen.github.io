<h5>My overview:</h5>
<p>This was my first game I had ever made, so I thought I would go for something very simple. I was familiar with python
as it was taught at my school, so I had about 2 years of experience at this point. I found that the most difficult
part of games development was that you had to test after you changed anything which slowed down the process.
It was very fun and was pleased with my first game even if the "artwork" (if you can call it that)
    were pretty terrible.</p>
