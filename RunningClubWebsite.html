<h1>Running club website improvement</h1>
<h3>Purpose: Client wanted the website to be improved</h3>
<h3>Languages used: HTML, CSS</h3>
<h3>Tools used: WordPress</h3>
<a href=""><h3>Code</h3></a>

<h4>Task Given: The client asked me to improve the website as it was too difficult to navigate</h4>
<h4>My improvements:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Split the 1 long page into 6 smaller pages to improve navigation issues</li>
    <li>Created a navigation bar to improve speed of navigation</li>
    <li>Added CSS to improve accessibility and to retain users</li>
</ul>

<h5>My overview:</h5>
<p>I was tasked to improve the Midsummer Fun Run webpage by someone I already knew as they knew I had experience
with website development. I enjoyed developing this webpage as I had never used WordPress before so
had to learn all the features that it used and how to implement CSS into it. Another part that I had not experienced
before, because I had always made projects for myself, was understanding the needs of the client which taught
me a lot about communication and feedback.</p>
