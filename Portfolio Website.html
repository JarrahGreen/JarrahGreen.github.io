    <li>Using JavaScript to develop visual effects</li>
</ul>

<h5>My overview:</h5>
<p>I have a CV which I used to apply to jobs that were not todo with computing but felt that if I were to explain my
experience on a piece of paper when applying for a computing job it would be difficult. Therefore, I thought it would
be good to develop a website that explained myself and my experience in a visual way. I had also never had a reason
to make a website so thought it would be fun to develop one myself and host it so employers could check out my
previous projects I had worked on.</p>
